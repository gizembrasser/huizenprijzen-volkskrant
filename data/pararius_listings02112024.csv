SELECTION PROCEDURE
Rotsvast will determine which applicants responded first based on received emails. Due to the expected large number of responses, not all applicants may be invited. This email must include at least the following information:
Name of tenant(s)
Explanation of the group composition
Gross annual income of tenant(s)
Applications that do not meet these requirements will not be processed.
Invitations for a viewing round are issued based on the order of received emails, and slots are on a “first-come, first-served” basis.
After viewing, an income and reliability screening will be conducted using various (public) registers. The tenant must successfully complete this screening and achieve a top score of 5 stars in our screening tool (Properize). The decision to rent out the property is entirely up to the property owner. If multiple candidates pass the screening, the choice is based on income, screening results, and the tenant’s personal circumstances. Tenants may explain their personal situation during the screening.
Candidates who are not assigned the property after screening have the right to request further explanation and, of course, may review the screening report.
NOTE: Rotsvast represents the owner's interests, who wishes to rent out as of the available date. Upon completing the screening, Rotsvast will directly propose a dossier to the owner. If a dossier has already been accepted, subsequent fully completed dossiers will no longer be considered. It is the responsibility of prospective tenants to submit a complete dossier as quickly as possible. Rotsvast will not actively update tenants on the progress of other candidates' screening processes. In a high-demand housing market, Rotsvast assumes that candidates are aware of the importance of timely action.

Nijmegen’s city center is only a 15-minute walk or a 5-minute bike ride from Canisiushof.

Choosing Lugano means opting for a highly central and accessible location. Shopping, catching a movie, dining out, theater, and your daily groceries are all right next door. The accessibility by car, bus, and train is also well-arranged. Amsterdam, Schiphol, The Hague, and the North Sea coast are all quickly reachable. But if you seek some peace and quiet, you can rely on your own apartment and its unobstructed views. That is Lugano.

Only candidates who confirm by email that they understand the content and accept all rental conditions and specific rules of the Municipality of Amsterdam will be selected.
The owner verifies your legal residency status and your identity, that your employment does not end within 24 months, that your net salary after payment of Dutch income tax is higher than € 2.700,00, that you do not smoke or use vapes or other drugs, that you have no negative residential history, why you want to move from your current home address, that you continue to behave as a good co-tenant that has understood the sharing rules.

Dutch law does not allow more than 2 adults to live together at 1 address. Unless the multiple people are family and form 1 household.

Our homes have permission that 3 and 4 people who are not family and do not want to form 1 household can legally share the home together and be legally registered.
The landlord does not provide cooking equipment per resident because then you no longer meet the conditions of the Municipality of Amsterdam to share the address with more than 2 people.
