Stunning (partly) furnished apartment of approximately 92 m² located on the beautiful Leliegracht in the Jordaan, between the Herengracht and the Keizersgracht! This gorgeous property is characterized by its stately marble entrance, high ceilings with ornate details, and the large balcony at the front with a view of the picturesque Leliegracht.
The canal was created in 1612 when the canal belt was dug southward from the Brouwersgracht. On the side of the Prinsengracht, remnants of a sluice can be seen. This sluice was necessary because the water level of the Prinsengracht (together with the other canals in the Jordaan) remained at polder level, while the water level of the Leliegracht, Keizersgracht, and Herengracht was at the higher city level."

Beautiful double-upstairs family home, with no fewer than 5 bedrooms in the middle of Statenkwartier!
Welcome to the Statenkwartier!
On the beautiful Van Slingelandtstraat, parallel to the beautiful shopping street Frederik Hendriklaan - De Fred - you have peace and quiet and amenities within easy reach. This neighborhood has been immensely popular for decades, and there's a reason for that! You can live wonderfully quietly in this beautiful and residential street. But just turn the corner and you will find yourself on the lively Fred, with its beautiful boutiques, (fresh) specialty shops, supermarkets and cozy restaurants. This location is fantastic, partly because of the short distance to the beach and the Scheveningen harbour, greenery and dunes 5 minutes away (Bosjes van Poot), and ideal for children with playgrounds, (primary) schools and childcare facilities in the vicinity. Easily accessible by public transport (bus and tram stops within walking distance) and ideal for expats who work at Europol or embassies, for example, just around the corner from the 'International zone'.
What makes this house special?
Enter your own entrance on the ground floor, stairs to the first floor. Spacious en suite living and dining room (approx. 14 meters deep!) with luxurious semi-open kitchen at the rear, equipped with built-in appliances (such as 6-burner gas stove, dishwasher, built-in microwave, fridge-freezer), large windows, lots of light! That makes it extra comfortable. Separate toilet and handy storage cupboard, and a bedroom at the front, ideal as a workplace or hobby room. Stairs to the top, where you will find no less than 4 more bedrooms! Two of an incredibly good size, both with access to their own balcony (front and rear). Two additional rooms at the front and rear (a total of 5 on both floors). Lots of light, also through skylights. The bathroom feels like a true spa: with a lovely bath, walk-in rain shower and double sink with furniture. In the hallway there is a separate toilet and cupboard with washing machine and dryer (these belong to the house). The house is fully equipped with double glazing. Luxury, comfort and space everywhere!
