SURROUNDINGS AND ACCESSIBILITY
Oostenburg is transformed into a beautiful, pleasant and car-free city district. Cyclists and walkers have priority here. The sturdy De Admiraal building stands in the center of Amsterdam, around the corner from the bustling VOC quay. Eiland Oostenburg offers a unique living environment for anyone who loves a lively city atmosphere. In recent years this part of the inner city has been transformed into a typical Amsterdam city district: contrasting, lively and tough. The Van Gendthallen, and the Werkspoorhal - Oostenburg's meeting heart - are being restored and given a new, partly commercial function. Oostenburg already had great appeal to people from outside with café-restaurants Roest and Rosa & Rita as crowd pullers. That attractiveness will only increase in the coming years with the arrival of even more restaurants, stores and the transformed Werkspoorhal and Van Gendthallen. From trendy restaurants to the cozy hip boutiques on Oostenburg and in the adjacent Czaar Peterstraat.

For rent in Amsterdam-Centre (Grachtengordel-Zuid):
Unique canal house of no less than 265 m2, situated on one of the most beautiful stretches of canal in Amsterdam. Living in this 17th-century building is enjoying authentic Amsterdam charm in perfect combination with space, luxury and comfort. The wonderfully light building has a beautifully landscaped city garden and of course offers a fantastic view over the Prinsengracht.
A canal house like this, which is not subdivided into flats but can be inhabited in its entirety, is usually rarely offered for rent. This example will be available immediately and will be delivered unfurnished.
SURROUNDINGS:
The property is situated on the Prinsengracht, between the Reguliersgracht and the Vijzelstraat. This part of the Prinsengracht consists mainly of houses and is characterized by a very pleasant atmosphere - city and village at the same time. Just a few minutes' walk away are the attractive Amstelveld, often called the most beautiful square in Amsterdam, and Utrechtsestraat, with its rich range of shops, restaurants, cafés and specialist shops. Albert Heijn is also just a two-minute walk away.
The location of the house can certainly be called central. The PC-Hoofstraat, the Rijksmuseum, the famous Nine Streets, the Leidseplein, the Rembrandtplein, the Kalverstraat: everything is within walking distance. The immediate surroundings offer a wide and diverse range of cultural amenities, including several cinemas and Royal Theatre Carré, as well as a wide range of catering establishments, gyms and yoga studios.
The accessibility by public transport is excellent. The metro stop of the North-South line is a very short walk away. It is only four minutes to Amsterdam Central Station, six minutes to the Zuidas business center and about twenty minutes to Schiphol Airport. The A10 and A2 motorways are also easily accessible from this part of Amsterdam.

The house is located on a quiet road, free parking, bordering a wide park-like green strip with the canal of 'De Blauwe Diamant' behind it; a sailing route through the forest but also to the lock at 'De Tulp'.

In the popular North part of Amsterdam we offer you this fully furnished modern loft apartment with sunny balcony.
Layout:
An elevator takes you to the 6th. floor where you can enter the apartment.
Situated on the South side of the apartment building with large windows and an entresol this apartment has a loft like feel to it.
The apartment is fully furnished and has an open plan kitchen with all appliances available.
A sunny balcony can be used here and stairs going up to the 7th floor takes you to a nice seating area and large bedroom which can be divided in a larger bedroom and a smaller second room that can be used for different purposes like a guestroom, home office or just some extra storage.
A bathroom with walk in shower, double sink and toilet is also located here.
Separate toilet and storage area available at the 6th floor.
Area:
This former industrial area has been transformed into one of the most popular areas to live in recent years with all sorts of shops, supermarkets, grocery stores and the NDSM-area (former shipyard), a cultural hotspot with restaurants, a city beach and lots of summer- and winter events just a few minutes away.
Noord is hip and happening. Buiksloterham is located between the cultural Overhoeks, Eye, Tolhuistuin, and the creative NDSM, featuring places like Pllek and Loetje. Close to the local Bloemenbuurt and the charming Buiksloterdijk, this is Noord at its best, where you experience the best of both worlds.
The waters of the IJ, the NDSM wharf, the new De Banne shopping center, the Noorderpark swimming pool, the renovated Van der Pekstraat with its market, the revamped Mosplein with various shops, and the heart of Noord, Winkelcentrum Boven 't IJ, are all within a short distance. There’s a wide variety of dining options, from traditional pubs with tablecloths to trendy bars, from just around the corner to the IJ river. The magic lies in the mix.
For (young) parents among us: Amsterdam-Noord has 31 primary schools (often with preschools) and 10 secondary schools. There is a broad selection of after-school care and daycare centers. Noord boasts 60 active sports clubs, 9 parks, 7 shopping centers, 2 markets, and one brand-new indoor and outdoor swimming pool.
The ferry takes you from Buiksloterweg to Central Station in just a few minutes (24/7) or from Distelweg to Westerdoksdijk. The North-South metro line, with the Noorderpark metro stop just a 5-minute bike ride away, gets you to the Zuidas in 10 minutes.
