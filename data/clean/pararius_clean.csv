ENGLISH VERSION BELOW
In dit rustige en kindvriendelijke deel van Den Hoorn ligt deze gestoffeerde en sfeervolle eengezinswoning uit 1959. Dit goed onderhouden huis met moderne voorzieningen biedt mogelijkheden: met maar liefst 5 kamers (waarvan 4 slaap/werkkamers) én een vrijstaande stenen berging heeft het jonge gezin, de intensieve thuiswerker en/of de enthousiaste hobbyist opties genoeg!
Deze buurt is zowel autoluw als goed verbonden met het bruisende hart van Den Hoorn en Delft (Delft CS op 7 minuten fietsen, de oude Delftse kern op 8). Binnen twee straten ben je eigenlijk overal: bij de supermarkt, ambachtelijke slager/bakker/groenteboer, basisschool, kinderopvang, bibliotheek, horeca, sporthal en medisch centrum. Toch Den Hoorn uit? Vanuit de woning op de A4 rijden of in de trein zitten is eveneens minutenwerk.
De moderne, open keuken (met Quooker, vaatwasser, inductiekookplaat, koel/vriescombinatie en combimagnetron) is samen met de zonovergoten woon- en eetkamer het huiselijke hart van de woning. De massief houten vloer draagt absoluut bij aan de warme uitstraling ervan. Grenzend aan de woonkamer bevindt zich de tuin die door de vier openslaande deuren laagdrempelig bereikbaar is. Daardoor zit je (en eet je) in de zomer zó in het zonnetje. De berging is voorzien van elektra en is daardoor een mooie hobbyruimte. Of fietsenhok: de tuin heeft een goed bereikbare achterom.
Op de eerste etage bevinden zich de badkamer en drie slaapkamers (met inbouwkasten), waarvan er eentje zonder al te veel moeite een thuiswerkkamer of ruime inloopkast kan worden. De tweede etage herbergt de vierde slaapkamer, aanvullende bergruimte, de HR CV-ketel en de aansluiting voor wasmachine en droger.
De woning wordt verhuurd zonder vaste vraagprijs, maar met een bandbreedte. Het profiel van de huurder(s) is voor de verhuurder belangrijker dan het rendement. Er is expliciet oog voor karakter, achtergrond, match met de buurt en eventuele bijzondere persoonlijke omstandigheden (exclusief financiële problemen). Omdat studenten niet in het straatbeeld passen, worden die op voorhand geweigerd evenals woningdelers die met drie of meer personen zijn. Om diezelfde reden hebben jonge (startende) gezinnen met kinderen op de basisschool of middelbare school in deze buurt absoluut een streepje voor. Evenals personen actief in onderwijs, gezondheidszorg, bouw of overheid. Bij gelijke gunfactor zal het uitgebrachte bod meewegen.
- per 01 januari 2025 beschikbaar;
- ruime gestoffeerde eengezinswoning (gebruiksoppervlakte: >110 m2);
- 5 kamers, 4 slaap/werkkamers;
- contract voor onbepaalde tijd met een minimumduur van 12 maanden;
- borgsom €1.000;
- geen inkomenseis, maar borgstelling derde(n) mogelijk nodig;
- geen harige of geklauwde huisdieren, geen rokers, geen drugsbezit;
- onder omstandigheden woningdelers mogelijk (niet meer dan twee);
- vraagprijs: €1.950 - €2.200 afhankelijk van profiel en gunfactor;
- indien een bod uitgebracht wordt aan lage kant van het spectrum: de verhuurder ziet graag de onderbouwing tegemoet waarom jullie de huurders zijn die ze moet hebben. Noem bijvoorbeeld de wijze waarop jullie onze maatschappij verrijken of van de hectiek ervan juist enige rust nodig hebben.
Interesse? Laat je ter nadere kennismaking uitnodigen voor een kopje koffie op de tweede zaterdag van november (09 november 2024).
ENGLISH VERSION
In this quiet and child-friendly part of Den Hoorn you'll find this unfurnished and warm single-family home from 1959. This well maintained residence with modern amenities possesses plenty of possibilities: with no less than 5 rooms (4 of which being work-/bedrooms) ánd a detached garden shed, this offers the young family, the contemporary remote-worker and/or the enthusiastic hobbyist the necessary options!
This neighbourhood is low in traffic while simultaneously being well connected to the bustling heart of Den Hoorn and Delft (Delft central station at 7 minutes by bike, its historic centre at 8). Within a radius of a mere two streets you find almost everything you reasonably need: a supermarket, artisanal baker/butcher/greengrocer, primary school, daycare, library, cafe/restaurants, sports facilities and medical centre. Need to leave Den Hoorn anyway? Boarding the train or driving on the highway is a matter of mere minutes.
The modern, open kitchen (with boiling water tap, dishwasher, induction cooker, refrigerator with freezer and microwave oven) is, together with the sun-lit living- and dining room, warm-beating heart of the house. The solid wooden floor give both rooms a warm appearance. Adjacent to the living room is a sunny garden that is readily accessible, courtesy of the four patio doors. That way, you’re sitting and dining in the summer sun in no-time. The garden shed is provided with electricity and is thus an excellent hobby room. Or bicycle shed: the garden is well accessible from the back alley.
On the first floor are the bathroom and three bedrooms (with fitted wardrobes), one of which can easily be transformed into a spacious walk-in closet or home office. The second floor contains the fourth bedroom, extra closet space, the HE boiler and piping for washing machine and dryer.
This lease is available not with a fixed asking price, but rather with a bandwidth. The profile of the tenant(s) is more important to the landlord than the return on investment. Factors as character, background, match with the neighbourhood and any special personal circumstances (excluding financial problems) will taken into account explicitly. Because graduates and undergraduates won’t fit well here, their applications will be refused in advance. As well as those from home sharers who are looking to rent with three or more persons. Likewise, young (starting) families with one or more children attending primary or secondary school absolutely have an advantage. As well as persons active in education, health-care, construction or public service. The bid made will be taken into account when personal factors are being deemed equal.
- available from first of January 2025;
- spacious unfurnished single-family house (>110 m2);
- 5 rooms, 4 bedrooms;
- contract for an undefined period with a minimum duration of 12 months;
- deposit: €1,000;
- no income requirement, but an additional guarantor may be required;
- no hairy or clawed pets, smokers or possession of illicit drugs;
- home sharers possible under certain circumstances (no more than two persons);
- asking price: €1,950 - €2,200 depending on profile and content of character;
- when bidding on the lower end of the spectrum: please convince the landlord why you are the tenant(s) worth having. Elaborate on your societal contribution for instance. Or the reason you need a quiet place to shield yourselves from the day-to-day racket our Randstad can bring along.

We are proud to present 9 family homes in the residential area Wilgenrijk, in Maasluis. Wilgenrijk is a green, rural and water-rich area with a high-quality vision on architecture and outdoor space that originates from the design philosophy 'the Maassluise School'. The style book 'the Maassluise School' originated from the search of 35 (landscape) architects and urban planners for the meaning of ""real, relaxing, Dutch, beautiful living"" and resulted in a residential area where it is pleasant to live, that offers relaxation and fits in with nature. Wilgenrijk consists of various cozy and small-scale neighborhoods, each with its own architectural characteristics, and is shielded from ambient noise by a recreational park wall. The area is also very child friendly due to the natural playgrounds, among other things.
Within walking distance of your house in Wilgenrijk is a unique green area, embellished by mills, canals and monumental farms with beautiful walking and cycling routes.

Libau Eiland is one of the seven islands that make up Amsterdam's newest district: Houthaven. A master plan was created for the development of this new district, in which each island was given its own theme.
Libau Island is the sixth built-up island on Houthaven and is named after a sturdy port (Liepãja) in Latvia and has the theme ‘Carpenters’. Wood dominates here. With somewhat lower buildings than on the other islands, with wooden facades, sloping roofs and many shades of grey and brown, Libau Island unmistakably refers to the original Houthaven. The natural materials and colors give a feeling of warmth, peace and familiarity.
Houthaven is being built between the Spaarndammerbuurt and the IJ and to the west of Amsterdam Central Station. In the middle of dynamic Amsterdam, surrounded by the IJ. Houthaven consists of seven islands that are connected by fifteen bridges.
The facilities that you depend on as a Libau Island resident are easily accessible. If not in Houthaven itself, then somewhere else in Amsterdam. Amsterdam West is ‘hip and happening’. In the very nearby Spaarndammerstraat you will find a wide range of shops and supermarkets. And on the Haarlemmerdijk, or in the Jordaan, just a 5 minutes bike ride from Houthaven, you will find even much more.
The Houthaven is completely car-free. So a minimum of parking spaces at street level, which ensures a quiet street scene and enough space for recreation. But of course, you can park your car. In a spacious parking garage accessible by lift is a fixed parking space (with a private electrical charging station) belonging to the apartment. All apartments in the Houthaven are built virtually climate-neutral. So low energy costs.
The apartment offered here is located on the top floor and is accessible by elevator.
Via the common hallway, entrance apartment on the 3rd floor in the hallway with access to all the rooms. The living and the luxurious open plan kitchen, with many built-in appliances, are both very bright due to the windows/ terrace-doors on each side. From the kitchen one enters the large balcony facing South-east.
The 2 (bed)-rooms are accessible via the hallway. The master bedroom is quite large and fitted with a double bed and wardrobe. The second room is very suitable as home-office and/or guest room. The bathroom has a walk-in shower, sink and towel radiator. Furthermore, there is a separate toilet, and a large utility/storage room with washing machine and tumble dryer.
Truly a fantastic, and spacious almost brand-new apartment in a unique location.

The Schelpenbuurt is a new, green and watery neighbourhood in Zeewolde. Living on and around a harbour island offers not only serenity but also the necessary liveliness. It is a relaxed coming and going of pleasure boats.

Collective heating
In the coming years, Ennatuurlijk will supply sustainable heat to the 3,000 homes in Zeewolde. The supply of this green heat is a unique energy-efficient project. The green heat is produced with a cogeneration on biogas from dairy farm Van Beek in Zeewolde. This is obtained from manure from cows, mixed with residues from arable farming, the food industry and grass cuttings from nature reserves.

Collective heating
In the coming years, Ennatuurlijk will supply sustainable heat to the 3,000 homes in Zeewolde. The supply of this green heat is a unique energy-efficient project. The green heat is produced with a cogeneration on biogas from dairy farm Van Beek in Zeewolde.

The living room is comfortably furnished and offers plenty of space to relax and enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows. The kitchen is equipped with modern appliances, such as a hob, oven, dishwasher and refrigerator. Here you can easily prepare the most delicious meals.

It is not for nothing that the Pijp is known as the nicest neighborhood in Amsterdam.

Because: not yet as busy as the many other squares, but it does have a lot of nice spots. And it is also close to the fine Sarphatipark. The nice thing about the Van Der Helstplein in De Pijp is that they have a lot of different spots on a relatively small square. For example, tasty pizzas, a nice restaurant for an evening of extensive dining, or a pub where you can go for a drink. ""You feel like you're in Paris""

Beautiful and very sustainable single-family house from 2019 of approx. 150m2 with no less than 6 bedrooms, sunny backyard on the southwest and parking on site.
This nice house is located in the child-friendly neighborhood Elzenhagen in Amsterdam North. The house has been finished with care to a high standard and is in a very good condition. Furthermore, this spacious family home has 6 bedrooms, a very extensive and luxurious kitchen equipped with high-quality built-in appliances (including steam oven and Quooker), a lovely garden on the southwest, underfloor heating on all floors and lots of natural light. Behind the house is a wooden shed and a private parking space.
ENERGY
Thanks to the solar panels on the roof, the house supplies more electricity to the network than the current residents use. In addition, the highest efficiency triple glazing and a connection to the district heating ensure efficient consumption of heating/hot water. All this makes living in this house very sustainable.
ENVIRONMENT:
The house is located in one of the newest districts of Amsterdam-North. This popular neighborhood is very child-friendly with several (nature) playgrounds and sports areas. Activities are organized in the neighborhood by the active residents for those who want to participate (King's Day, neighbors day, boot camp, etc.). With the North-South line just a few minutes' walk away, you can reach the heart of Amsterdam within 5 minutes and the Zuidas within 15 minutes. You can reach the A8 or A10 by car in about 3 minutes. And within 15 minutes by bike you are on the ferry to Central Station.
The Boven 't Y shopping center is within walking distance, with well-known retail chains such as H&M, Decathlon, Hema & Albert Heijn, but also the necessary craft shops. The Pathé cinema (12 screens), and various restaurants including ""De Beren"" and the recently opened ""Boules & Bites Bar"" are within walking distance. Hip restaurants & bars can be found throughout Amsterdam-North, such as Pompet, Il Pecorino, Cannibale Royale, De Goudfazant, Oedipus Brewery, Pllek, IJver and Loetje aan 't IJ. Too many to mention!
There are plenty of green spaces in the area; in no time you cycle to the cozy Noorderpark or Landelijk Noord with the picturesque villages such as Zunderdorp, Ransdorp & Durgerdam. The Twiske recreation area is also around the corner. For other entertainment, there is plenty to do within cycling distance, such as the Buiktuin petting zoo, the Adam Toren, the EYE Film Museum or the NDSM site, where fun festivals can be found all year round.
LAYOUT:
You enter the house through the front garden in the hall with wardrobe, meter cupboard and toilet with hand basin.
Then you step into the bright living room with sliding doors to the garden on the southwest. The very luxurious kitchen has patio doors to the front garden and is equipped with high-quality built-in appliances (from Siemens and Quooker, among others) with a large WiFi steam oven, combi oven, quooker, induction and fridge/freezer combination with hyperfresh function.
The landing on the first floor provides access to three bedrooms and the bathroom with a sink with double taps, spacious walk-in shower, toilet and bath. The master bedroom has a large built-in wardrobe over the entire width. The front bedroom is a good size with floor to ceiling windows and French balcony.
The staircase to the second floor leads to another three bedrooms. The spacious indoor storage room with sink, washing machine and dryer is also located here.

SURROUNDINGS AND ACCESSIBILITY
Oostenburg is transformed into a beautiful, pleasant and car-free city district. Cyclists and walkers have priority here. The sturdy De Admiraal building stands in the center of Amsterdam, around the corner from the bustling VOC quay. Eiland Oostenburg offers a unique living environment for anyone who loves a lively city atmosphere. In recent years this part of the inner city has been transformed into a typical Amsterdam city district: contrasting, lively and tough. The Van Gendthallen, and the Werkspoorhal - Oostenburg's meeting heart - are being restored and given a new, partly commercial function. Oostenburg already had great appeal to people from outside with café-restaurants Roest and Rosa & Rita as crowd pullers. That attractiveness will only increase in the coming years with the arrival of even more restaurants, stores and the transformed Werkspoorhal and Van Gendthallen. From trendy restaurants to the cozy hip boutiques on Oostenburg and in the adjacent Czaar Peterstraat.

For rent! Right on the edge of the Horsterveld is this beautiful unfurnished family home. The characteristic element of this home is the light high staircase. This gives you a spacious feeling on every floor. What also catches the eye is the high lean-to roof with large dormer window at the front. This creates a high attic floor where two bedrooms have been created. In addition, the house has been extended at the rear, creating a lovely spacious living room.
As mentioned, the house is in a great location. The house is located on a quiet road, free parking, bordering a wide park-like green strip with the canal of 'De Blauwe Diamant' behind it; a sailing route through the forest but also to the lock at 'De Tulp'. A boat ramp makes it easy to go into the water, but an afternoon of fishing in front of the door is also a great idea. Schools and a local supermarket Plus are located in the neighborhood.

In the popular North part of Amsterdam we offer you this fully furnished modern loft apartment with sunny balcony.
Layout:
An elevator takes you to the 6th. floor where you can enter the apartment.
Situated on the South side of the apartment building with large windows and an entresol this apartment has a loft like feel to it.
The apartment is fully furnished and has an open plan kitchen with all appliances available.
A sunny balcony can be used here and stairs going up to the 7th floor takes you to a nice seating area and large bedroom which can be divided in a larger bedroom and a smaller second room that can be used for different purposes like a guestroom, home office or just some extra storage.
A bathroom with walk in shower, double sink and toilet is also located here.
Separate toilet and storage area available at the 6th floor.
Area:
This former industrial area has been transformed into one of the most popular areas to live in recent years with all sorts of shops, supermarkets, grocery stores and the NDSM-area (former shipyard), a cultural hotspot with restaurants, a city beach and lots of summer- and winter events just a few minutes away.
Noord is hip and happening. Buiksloterham is located between the cultural Overhoeks, Eye, Tolhuistuin, and the creative NDSM, featuring places like Pllek and Loetje. Close to the local Bloemenbuurt and the charming Buiksloterdijk, this is Noord at its best, where you experience the best of both worlds.
The waters of the IJ, the NDSM wharf, the new De Banne shopping center, the Noorderpark swimming pool, the renovated Van der Pekstraat with its market, the revamped Mosplein with various shops, and the heart of Noord, Winkelcentrum Boven 't IJ, are all within a short distance. There’s a wide variety of dining options, from traditional pubs with tablecloths to trendy bars, from just around the corner to the IJ river. The magic lies in the mix.
For (young) parents among us: Amsterdam-Noord has 31 primary schools (often with preschools) and 10 secondary schools. There is a broad selection of after-school care and daycare centers. Noord boasts 60 active sports clubs, 9 parks, 7 shopping centers, 2 markets, and one brand-new indoor and outdoor swimming pool.
The ferry takes you from Buiksloterweg to Central Station in just a few minutes (24/7) or from Distelweg to Westerdoksdijk. The North-South metro line, with the Noorderpark metro stop just a 5-minute bike ride away, gets you to the Zuidas in 10 minutes.
