LOCATION
Canisiushof is located at Berg en Dalseweg in the neighborhood of Hunnerberg, east of Nijmegen’s city center. This neighborhood is well-connected. With Julianapark only 5 minutes away, you’re standing in nature within minutes.
There are two bus stops (Hugo de Grootstraat and Mesdagstraat) along the street.
Get your groceries at one of the supermarkets nearby, like Albert Heijn (450 meters) or Coop (500 meters).
Nijmegen’s city center is only a 15-minute walk or a 5-minute bike ride from Canisiushof.
ABOUT CONTRACT
Short-stay contract for 6 months
Deposit is approx. 1x all-in rent
Income requirement is approx. 3.5x all-in rent
This residence is offered with a short-stay contract. Initially, the residences of Canisiushof are reserved for exchange students, expats, and working professionals who need an urgent temporary housing solution (i.e. due to home renovation, home sale, relationship problems, internship, or temporary work in or around Nijmegen). If you are already living in - or around - Nijmegen, you probably do not meet the conditions to book this residence with a short-stay contract. Note that you cannot rent a short-stay residence if you have been a tenant of Holland2Stay before.
