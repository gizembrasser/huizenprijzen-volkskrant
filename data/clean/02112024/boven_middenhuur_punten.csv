Beautiful 3-Room Apartment in Hoofddorp!
Upon entering, you have access to two comfortable bedrooms, a spacious bathroom with a bathtub, double sinks, and a shower, as well as a separate toilet. Additionally, you'll find a convenient storage room. The living room is wonderfully spacious and provides access to the balcony, where you can fully enjoy the fresh air. The open kitchen is equipped with built-in appliances, perfect for preparing delicious meals.
Located at the corner of Burgemeester van Stamplein and Raadhuisplein, Lugano offers a prime location. The Vier Meren, with its shops, restaurants, cinema, and theater, is literally next door. At the same time, the center of Hoofddorp is exceptionally accessible. From your apartment, it's just a 15-minute drive to Schiphol or a 30-minute drive to downtown Amsterdam. The bus stops right outside, and you can park your car in your designated spot in Lugano's parking garage.
Returning home means always coming back to your beautifully finished apartment with a lovely outdoor space and expansive views. The apartments are all spacious and finished to a high standard with luxury fixtures and a complete kitchen.
The Area
Choosing Lugano means opting for a highly central and accessible location. Shopping, catching a movie, dining out, theater, and your daily groceries are all right next door. The accessibility by car, bus, and train is also well-arranged. Amsterdam, Schiphol, The Hague, and the North Sea coast are all quickly reachable. But if you seek some peace and quiet, you can rely on your own apartment and its unobstructed views. That is Lugano.

SELECTION PROCEDURE
Rotsvast will determine which applicants responded first based on received emails. Due to the expected large number of responses, not all applicants may be invited. This email must include at least the following information:
Name of tenant(s)
Explanation of the group composition
Gross annual income of tenant(s)
Applications that do not meet these requirements will not be processed.
Invitations for a viewing round are issued based on the order of received emails, and slots are on a “first-come, first-served” basis.
After viewing, an income and reliability screening will be conducted using various (public) registers. The tenant must successfully complete this screening and achieve a top score of 5 stars in our screening tool (Properize). The decision to rent out the property is entirely up to the property owner. If multiple candidates pass the screening, the choice is based on income, screening results, and the tenant’s personal circumstances. Tenants may explain their personal situation during the screening.
Candidates who are not assigned the property after screening have the right to request further explanation and, of course, may review the screening report.
NOTE: Rotsvast represents the owner's interests, who wishes to rent out as of the available date. Upon completing the screening, Rotsvast will directly propose a dossier to the owner. If a dossier has already been accepted, subsequent fully completed dossiers will no longer be considered. It is the responsibility of prospective tenants to submit a complete dossier as quickly as possible. Rotsvast will not actively update tenants on the progress of other candidates' screening processes. In a high-demand housing market, Rotsvast assumes that candidates are aware of the importance of timely action.
