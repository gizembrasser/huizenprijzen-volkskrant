Location:
Is it possible to live comfortably in a building with history? Yes, and in the heart of Alkmaar too. In a monumental Neo-Renaissance building from 1889 designed by the Alkmaar architect F. Vetser (1829-1903), 12 luxuriously finished apartments have been realized at Verdronkenoord 28 (former bank office). The monumental building is beautifully situated along the Alkmaar canal in the historic Alkmaar city center with the shopping / catering area within walking distance. In the immediate vicinity is the Accijnstoren, Eenhoornbrug and the famous Sint Laurentius Church.
On the water at Verdronkenoord 28, the Segesta Group has again succeeded in realizing twelve apartments with the living comfort of today, combined with the atmosphere of the past.
Heart of Alkmaar
At the end of the Verdronkenoord you are in the heart of Alkmaar. The Platte Stenen bridge, the Waagplein and D'Oude stad, with numerous cafes and restaurants and in the summer the world-famous cheese market. The extensive shopping area around Laat and Langestraat is also nearby.
An ideal residential location for anyone who loves the living comfort of today and the atmosphere and appearance of the past.",False,,Binnenstad-Oost,alkmaar,345000.0,139.07
