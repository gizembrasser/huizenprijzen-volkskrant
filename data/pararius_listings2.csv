ENGLISH VERSION BELOW
In dit rustige en kindvriendelijke deel van Den Hoorn ligt deze gestoffeerde en sfeervolle eengezinswoning uit 1959. Dit goed onderhouden huis met moderne voorzieningen biedt mogelijkheden: met maar liefst 5 kamers (waarvan 4 slaap/werkkamers) én een vrijstaande stenen berging heeft het jonge gezin, de intensieve thuiswerker en/of de enthousiaste hobbyist opties genoeg!
Deze buurt is zowel autoluw als goed verbonden met het bruisende hart van Den Hoorn en Delft (Delft CS op 7 minuten fietsen, de oude Delftse kern op 8). Binnen twee straten ben je eigenlijk overal: bij de supermarkt, ambachtelijke slager/bakker/groenteboer, basisschool, kinderopvang, bibliotheek, horeca, sporthal en medisch centrum. Toch Den Hoorn uit? Vanuit de woning op de A4 rijden of in de trein zitten is eveneens minutenwerk.
De moderne, open keuken (met Quooker, vaatwasser, inductiekookplaat, koel/vriescombinatie en combimagnetron) is samen met de zonovergoten woon- en eetkamer het huiselijke hart van de woning. De massief houten vloer draagt absoluut bij aan de warme uitstraling ervan. Grenzend aan de woonkamer bevindt zich de tuin die door de vier openslaande deuren laagdrempelig bereikbaar is. Daardoor zit je (en eet je) in de zomer zó in het zonnetje. De berging is voorzien van elektra en is daardoor een mooie hobbyruimte. Of fietsenhok: de tuin heeft een goed bereikbare achterom.
Op de eerste etage bevinden zich de badkamer en drie slaapkamers (met inbouwkasten), waarvan er eentje zonder al te veel moeite een thuiswerkkamer of ruime inloopkast kan worden. De tweede etage herbergt de vierde slaapkamer, aanvullende bergruimte, de HR CV-ketel en de aansluiting voor wasmachine en droger.
De woning wordt verhuurd zonder vaste vraagprijs, maar met een bandbreedte. Het profiel van de huurder(s) is voor de verhuurder belangrijker dan het rendement. Er is expliciet oog voor karakter, achtergrond, match met de buurt en eventuele bijzondere persoonlijke omstandigheden (exclusief financiële problemen). Omdat studenten niet in het straatbeeld passen, worden die op voorhand geweigerd evenals woningdelers die met drie of meer personen zijn. Om diezelfde reden hebben jonge (startende) gezinnen met kinderen op de basisschool of middelbare school in deze buurt absoluut een streepje voor. Evenals personen actief in onderwijs, gezondheidszorg, bouw of overheid. Bij gelijke gunfactor zal het uitgebrachte bod meewegen.
- per 01 januari 2025 beschikbaar;
- ruime gestoffeerde eengezinswoning (gebruiksoppervlakte: >110 m2);
- 5 kamers, 4 slaap/werkkamers;
- contract voor onbepaalde tijd met een minimumduur van 12 maanden;
- borgsom €1.000;
- geen inkomenseis, maar borgstelling derde(n) mogelijk nodig;
- geen harige of geklauwde huisdieren, geen rokers, geen drugsbezit;
- onder omstandigheden woningdelers mogelijk (niet meer dan twee);
- vraagprijs: €1.950 - €2.200 afhankelijk van profiel en gunfactor;
- indien een bod uitgebracht wordt aan lage kant van het spectrum: de verhuurder ziet graag de onderbouwing tegemoet waarom jullie de huurders zijn die ze moet hebben. Noem bijvoorbeeld de wijze waarop jullie onze maatschappij verrijken of van de hectiek ervan juist enige rust nodig hebben.
Interesse? Laat je ter nadere kennismaking uitnodigen voor een kopje koffie op de tweede zaterdag van november (09 november 2024).
ENGLISH VERSION
In this quiet and child-friendly part of Den Hoorn you'll find this unfurnished and warm single-family home from 1959. This well maintained residence with modern amenities possesses plenty of possibilities: with no less than 5 rooms (4 of which being work-/bedrooms) ánd a detached garden shed, this offers the young family, the contemporary remote-worker and/or the enthusiastic hobbyist the necessary options!
This neighbourhood is low in traffic while simultaneously being well connected to the bustling heart of Den Hoorn and Delft (Delft central station at 7 minutes by bike, its historic centre at 8). Within a radius of a mere two streets you find almost everything you reasonably need: a supermarket, artisanal baker/butcher/greengrocer, primary school, daycare, library, cafe/restaurants, sports facilities and medical centre. Need to leave Den Hoorn anyway? Boarding the train or driving on the highway is a matter of mere minutes.
The modern, open kitchen (with boiling water tap, dishwasher, induction cooker, refrigerator with freezer and microwave oven) is, together with the sun-lit living- and dining room, warm-beating heart of the house. The solid wooden floor give both rooms a warm appearance. Adjacent to the living room is a sunny garden that is readily accessible, courtesy of the four patio doors. That way, you’re sitting and dining in the summer sun in no-time. The garden shed is provided with electricity and is thus an excellent hobby room. Or bicycle shed: the garden is well accessible from the back alley.
On the first floor are the bathroom and three bedrooms (with fitted wardrobes), one of which can easily be transformed into a spacious walk-in closet or home office. The second floor contains the fourth bedroom, extra closet space, the HE boiler and piping for washing machine and dryer.
This lease is available not with a fixed asking price, but rather with a bandwidth. The profile of the tenant(s) is more important to the landlord than the return on investment. Factors as character, background, match with the neighbourhood and any special personal circumstances (excluding financial problems) will taken into account explicitly. Because graduates and undergraduates won’t fit well here, their applications will be refused in advance. As well as those from home sharers who are looking to rent with three or more persons. Likewise, young (starting) families with one or more children attending primary or secondary school absolutely have an advantage. As well as persons active in education, health-care, construction or public service. The bid made will be taken into account when personal factors are being deemed equal.
- available from first of January 2025;
- spacious unfurnished single-family house (>110 m2);
- 5 rooms, 4 bedrooms;
- contract for an undefined period with a minimum duration of 12 months;
- deposit: €1,000;
- no income requirement, but an additional guarantor may be required;
- no hairy or clawed pets, smokers or possession of illicit drugs;
- home sharers possible under certain circumstances (no more than two persons);
- asking price: €1,950 - €2,200 depending on profile and content of character;
- when bidding on the lower end of the spectrum: please convince the landlord why you are the tenant(s) worth having. Elaborate on your societal contribution for instance. Or the reason you need a quiet place to shield yourselves from the day-to-day racket our Randstad can bring along.
Interested? Get yourself invited for a cup of coffee to get acquainted on Novembers second Saturday (November 09th)."

We are proud to present 9 family homes in the residential area Wilgenrijk, in Maasluis. Wilgenrijk is a green, rural and water-rich area with a high-quality vision on architecture and outdoor space that originates from the design philosophy 'the Maassluise School'. The style book 'the Maassluise School' originated from the search of 35 (landscape) architects and urban planners for the meaning of ""real, relaxing, Dutch, beautiful living"" and resulted in a residential area where it is pleasant to live, that offers relaxation and fits in with nature. Wilgenrijk consists of various cozy and small-scale neighborhoods, each with its own architectural characteristics, and is shielded from ambient noise by a recreational park wall. The area is also very child friendly due to the natural playgrounds, among other things.
Within walking distance of your house in Wilgenrijk is a unique green area, embellished by mills, canals and monumental farms with beautiful walking and cycling routes. Several supermarkets and the historic village center are within cycling distance.

Libau Eiland is one of the seven islands that make up Amsterdam's newest district: Houthaven. A master plan was created for the development of this new district, in which each island was given its own theme.
Libau Island is the sixth built-up island on Houthaven and is named after a sturdy port (Liepãja) in Latvia and has the theme ‘Carpenters’. Wood dominates here. With somewhat lower buildings than on the other islands, with wooden facades, sloping roofs and many shades of grey and brown, Libau Island unmistakably refers to the original Houthaven. The natural materials and colors give a feeling of warmth, peace and familiarity.
Houthaven is being built between the Spaarndammerbuurt and the IJ and to the west of Amsterdam Central Station. In the middle of dynamic Amsterdam, surrounded by the IJ. Houthaven consists of seven islands that are connected by fifteen bridges.
The facilities that you depend on as a Libau Island resident are easily accessible. If not in Houthaven itself, then somewhere else in Amsterdam. Amsterdam West is ‘hip and happening’. In the very nearby Spaarndammerstraat you will find a wide range of shops and supermarkets. And on the Haarlemmerdijk, or in the Jordaan, just a 5 minutes bike ride from Houthaven, you will find even much more.
The Houthaven is completely car-free. So a minimum of parking spaces at street level, which ensures a quiet street scene and enough space for recreation. But of course, you can park your car. In a spacious parking garage accessible by lift is a fixed parking space (with a private electrical charging station) belonging to the apartment. All apartments in the Houthaven are built virtually climate-neutral. So low energy costs.
The apartment offered here is located on the top floor and is accessible by elevator.
Via the common hallway, entrance apartment on the 3rd floor in the hallway with access to all the rooms. The living and the luxurious open plan kitchen, with many built-in appliances, are both very bright due to the windows/ terrace-doors on each side. From the kitchen one enters the large balcony facing South-east.
The 2 (bed)-rooms are accessible via the hallway. The master bedroom is quite large and fitted with a double bed and wardrobe. The second room is very suitable as home-office and/or guest room. The bathroom has a walk-in shower, sink and towel radiator. Furthermore, there is a separate toilet, and a large utility/storage room with washing machine and tumble dryer.
Truly a fantastic, and spacious almost brand-new apartment in a unique location.

This apartment is not suitable for sharing.
This is a beautiful 3 room apartment located on the popular Rustenburgerstraat in Amsterdam. The apartment has a spacious and cozy living room, two bedrooms, a modern open kitchen and a neat bathroom with a shower and bath. But that's not all, because this apartment also has a spacious roof terrace where you can enjoy the sun and the view over the city.
The living room is comfortably furnished and offers plenty of space to relax and enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows. The kitchen is equipped with modern appliances, such as a hob, oven, dishwasher and refrigerator. Here you can easily prepare the most delicious meals.
The apartment has two bedrooms/offices. The master bedroom is comfortably furnished and has a spacious closet. The bathroom is neat and equipped with a shower, sink and toilet.
But the best thing about this apartment is the roof terrace! Here you can enjoy the sun and the view of Amsterdam all day long. The terrace is large enough to relax, eat and socialize with friends and family.
Surroundings: With the Sarphatipark around the corner, the Ceintuurbaan, Ferdinand Bolstraat and Albert Cuypstraat within walking distance, you don't have to go far for the daily message, a nice cup of coffee, a breath of fresh air in the green or just a cozy restaurant.
It is not for nothing that the Pijp is known as the nicest neighborhood in Amsterdam.
The apartment is also within walking distance of the Van der Helstplein. This square is fast becoming the new cozy square of De Pijp. Because: not yet as busy as the many other squares, but it does have a lot of nice spots. And it is also close to the fine Sarphatipark. The nice thing about the Van Der Helstplein in De Pijp is that they have a lot of different spots on a relatively small square. For example, tasty pizzas, a nice restaurant for an evening of extensive dining, or a pub where you can go for a drink. ""You feel like you're in Paris""
By public transport you can reach Central Station or Station Zuid in a short time via the north / south line and by car you are quickly on the Ring A10 and then the A2, A1 or A4."

Beautiful and very sustainable single-family house from 2019 of approx. 150m2 with no less than 6 bedrooms, sunny backyard on the southwest and parking on site.
This nice house is located in the child-friendly neighborhood Elzenhagen in Amsterdam North. The house has been finished with care to a high standard and is in a very good condition. Furthermore, this spacious family home has 6 bedrooms, a very extensive and luxurious kitchen equipped with high-quality built-in appliances (including steam oven and Quooker), a lovely garden on the southwest, underfloor heating on all floors and lots of natural light. Behind the house is a wooden shed and a private parking space.
ENERGY
Thanks to the solar panels on the roof, the house supplies more electricity to the network than the current residents use. In addition, the highest efficiency triple glazing and a connection to the district heating ensure efficient consumption of heating/hot water. All this makes living in this house very sustainable.
ENVIRONMENT:
The house is located in one of the newest districts of Amsterdam-North. This popular neighborhood is very child-friendly with several (nature) playgrounds and sports areas. Activities are organized in the neighborhood by the active residents for those who want to participate (King's Day, neighbors day, boot camp, etc.). With the North-South line just a few minutes' walk away, you can reach the heart of Amsterdam within 5 minutes and the Zuidas within 15 minutes. You can reach the A8 or A10 by car in about 3 minutes. And within 15 minutes by bike you are on the ferry to Central Station.
The Boven 't Y shopping center is within walking distance, with well-known retail chains such as H&M, Decathlon, Hema & Albert Heijn, but also the necessary craft shops. The Pathé cinema (12 screens), and various restaurants including ""De Beren"" and the recently opened ""Boules & Bites Bar"" are within walking distance. Hip restaurants & bars can be found throughout Amsterdam-North, such as Pompet, Il Pecorino, Cannibale Royale, De Goudfazant, Oedipus Brewery, Pllek, IJver and Loetje aan 't IJ. Too many to mention!
There are plenty of green spaces in the area; in no time you cycle to the cozy Noorderpark or Landelijk Noord with the picturesque villages such as Zunderdorp, Ransdorp & Durgerdam. The Twiske recreation area is also around the corner. For other entertainment, there is plenty to do within cycling distance, such as the Buiktuin petting zoo, the Adam Toren, the EYE Film Museum or the NDSM site, where fun festivals can be found all year round.
LAYOUT:
You enter the house through the front garden in the hall with wardrobe, meter cupboard and toilet with hand basin.
Then you step into the bright living room with sliding doors to the garden on the southwest. The very luxurious kitchen has patio doors to the front garden and is equipped with high-quality built-in appliances (from Siemens and Quooker, among others) with a large WiFi steam oven, combi oven, quooker, induction and fridge/freezer combination with hyperfresh function.

Very well maintained and available immediately!
This beautiful contemporary villa with a generous living area of 202m2 is located in the popular district “Dierdonk” in Helmond, and as the house name suggests, it is close to the edge of the forest of the “Bakelsbosch”.

For example, the High Tech Campus is within a range of 25 minutes by car, and ASML 30 minutes by car. The center of Eindhoven is within just 20 minutes.
The house was recently tested at an energy label B, and through the presence of 8 high-quality solar panels, your electricity costs will be low.
There is also good wall, roof, and floor insulation installed around the entire house and the windows have HR++ glazing.
